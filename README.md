This project is a MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack project. MERN stack is a popular technology stack for building web applications, it uses MongoDB as a database, Express.js as a web framework, React.js as a front-end library, and Node.js as a back-end runtime environment.

The project is a room reservation system, which allows customers to search for and book rooms, and sellers to manage their inventory and promote their rooms. The project includes several create functions such as Register, Book Now, Add rooms, seller Register, Blog create by seller, feedback create and Service create by seller, which allows customers and sellers to interact with the system.

The data collected from these functions is stored in MongoDB, a NoSQL database, which provides flexibility and scalability for the project. Express.js is used as a web framework, it allows for the creation of RESTful APIs, which connects the front-end React.js with the back-end Node.js and MongoDB. React.js is used as a front-end library, it allows for the creation of a dynamic and interactive user interface, which can efficiently update the data without requiring a page refresh. Node.js is used as a back-end runtime environment, it allows for the execution of JavaScript code on the server-side, which enables the project to handle server-side logic and connect with the database.

Overall, the MERN stack provides a powerful and efficient technology stack for building this room reservation system project, with a robust back-end and a responsive and user-friendly front-end.
